# Homework Three - Password Generator

## Description

When the user click the "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts asks the user how long they'd like the password to be and whether they like it to contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and/or numbers.

The user is able to designate the length of the password and exclude or include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and/or numbers. The length of the password must be between 8 and 128 characters. If the user enters a number outside of those parameters, the password will display "null" and halt the generation process. The user can click the red button again and restart the process.

Once the user makes their choices, a password, matching the user's entered criteria, generates on the page.

An example of a generated password can be seen below:
