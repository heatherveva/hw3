# Homework Three - Password Generator

## Description

When the user click the "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts asks the user how long they'd like the password to be and whether they like it to contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and/or numbers.

The user is able to designate the length of the password and preclude or include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and/or numbers. The length of the password must be between 8 and 128 characters. If the user enters a number outside of those parameters, an alert will tell them the criteria and ask them to restart the process.

Once the user makes their choices, a password, matching the user's entered criteria, generates on the page.
